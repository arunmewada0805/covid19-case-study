In these reports they have, since 22nd March, included a total cumulative figure of tests performed. It is not clear whether this is equivalent to the number of people tested; the fact that they also report the share of these that are positive suggests this might be the case. Weekly epidemiological reports are also published prior to 22nd March, however, they only include figures on confirmed cases and do not include quantiative figures on the number of tests performed. Data for 2nd April comes from the most recent Federal Ministry of Health report: these have not yet been published nationally by the Australian Department for Health since we are awaiting its latest weekly epidemiological report. The first data point is for the week ending 22nd March (143,056 cumulative tests performed). It is not clear from what date this total refers."

These updates are not provided daily – typically every few days, so a daily time-series is not available. However, using web archives we can construct a time-series of tests conducted over time based on these frequent updates. It is not clear when testing first began; data is only available from 5th March where it was reported that 5334 tests had been conducted."

It updates the page daily to report the latest cumulative number of people tested. To build a time series we have aggregated the data from previous version's of the Government of Canada website from Web Archive. Data refers to the number of patients tested: it is the sum of positive and negative results (which are also provided), hence it does not include people who have their test results pending. By combining daily snapshots, there is a large break/jump in the series from 17th to 18th March 2020. This is likely (the Government of Canada website does not make the reasoning clear, only publishes a slightly different format of table) the result of a large backlog of tests waiting to be processed. This makes the data misleading to use in time-series format prior to 18th March. We therefore only use data from 18th March onwards for comparability."
France - units unclear,31/3/2020,https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/content/download/241500/2553628,Agence nationale de santé publique,Adding up hospital and laboratory tests,224254,,3412.203664,,Agence nationale de santé publique,https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/recherche/#search=COVID-19%20:%20point%20epidemiologique&sort=dat,"The testing figures are labelled as ‘number of tests’ in the source, but as of 2 April we are unsure of the right interpretation of the units.","The source publishes epidemiological updates at irregular intervals. The latest update, as of 2 April, was published on the 24 March. The updates include a figure for the number of tests (‘Nombre de tests’). However the context in which the figures are published suggests that these numbers may actually refer to the number of individuals tested. A breakdown into positive and negative results are given, along with a positive test rate.

Such a breakdown seems counter-intuitive if the figures relate to the number of tests performed rather than the number of individuals tested. In the former case, it would mean that the tests from people who had two two tests – e.g. both positive – would be added to tests of people who had five tests – e.g. three negative and two positive.

The figures in the time series relate to tests performed since 24 February. In the 24 March update, in addition to the previously reported hospital tests, laboratory tests are also reported. Only the total number of laboratory tests performed between 24 February and 24 March is presented, without a time series. Our figure for 24 March adds the cumulative number of laboratory tests since 24 February (6,500) to the hospital tests figure (101,046). As such 24 March represents a break in the series."
Germany - samples tested,29/3/2020,https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/2020-04-1-de.pdf?__blob=publicationFile,Robert Koch Institut,"Directly quoted as number of ""Proben"" (samples) in the weekly report",918460,,11127.39269,,Robert Koch Institut,https://www.rki.de/SiteGlobals/Forms/Suche/serviceSucheForm.html?nn=2725444&input_=2375194&gts=2725442_list%253DdateOfIssue_dt%252Bdesc&resourceId=2390936&submit.x=0&submit.y=0&searchEngineQueryString=T%C3%A4glicher+Lagebericht+des+RKI+zur+Coronavirus-Krankheit-2019&pageLocale=de,The number of samples tested. The number of laboratories reporting in the data seems to vary from week to week.,"To determine how many laboratory tests regarding SARS-CoV-2 are carried out per calendar week in Germany and how many tests are positive or negative, the RKI has started a Germany-wide laboratory query. However, the number of laboratories reporting data seems to vary from week to week.

The report published on 1 April states that “from the beginning of the collection up to and including calendar week 13/2020”:
– The cumulative total of samples tested was 918460;
– For calendar week 13 (which ends on 29 March), 143 labs reported 354521 samples tested;
– For calendar week 12 (which ends on 22 March), 176 labs reported 348619 samples tested;
– For calendar week 11 (which ends on 15 March), 114 labs reported 127457 samples tested.

By subtracting each weekly change from the cumulative total, we can retrospectively work out the cumulative totals by the end of each week:
– By 29 March: 918460 total samples tested;
– By 22 March: 918460 – 354521 = 563939 samples tested;
– By 15 March: 563939 – 348619 = 215320 samples tested;
– By 8 March: 215320 – 127457 = 87863 samples tested.

Since laboratories can post-check the tests of past calendar weeks in the RKI test number query, it is possible that these numbers will increase slightly."

It isn't clear what exact date these cumulative tests date back to, but it is earlier than 10 Feb when the source reports 938 people had been tested. Prior to the 10 Feb, the press releases provide reports of coronavirus infections for the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Yokohama port.

There are two cases where the cumulative number of people tested falls: (1) 19/03 and (2) 25/03. For case (1) see footnote 4 which indicates a past mistake has been noticed and the cumulative figure revised on the date to adjust for this. For case (2), we could not find the associated footnote.

The Project aim to report on the number of people tested, including private labs, but not all states report their figures in this way.","This is a collaborative project launched in order to fill some of the important gaps in the testing figures being collated by the CDC.

Testing data is gathered from individual states, as reported in state health department websites, data dashboards and press releases from officials.

States currently report testing figures in a range of different ways: some report the number of tests performed, others the number of people tested; some include private labs, others not; some report negative test results, others only positive test results; some include pending tests, others do not (below we show figures that exclude explicitly pending results).

Moreover, many states do not explicitly provide details about these important factors needed to interpret the data they provide. 

There are issues in comparing the figures over time. The totals given for early on in the outbreak do not include all states.3 One significant uncertainty is the extent to which the rapid rise in tests seen from the mid-March in part reflects states beginning to report private lab tests.

Overall the figures should be seen as providing a general indication of testing output, rather than a specific count of a given indicator. Given the very incomplete coverage and reporting delays of the CDC data, it provides a very important additional perspective.

The Project documents their work in lots of detail. See the link provided above for full details."

- ""The actual number of infections in Finland is probably higher than reported, as not all mild symptoms have been tested so far and no information is available on the number of asymptomatic infections.""
- ""Coronavirus testing is performed in both the public and private sectors in several laboratories.""

The data description notes that tests are being rationed and allocated according to the following strategy: ""Samples are taken primarily from patients with severe symptoms of respiratory infection and from health and social care staff to ensure staff health and labor adequacy....Attention has also been paid to vulnerable groups of patients with some underlying disease and to those over 70 years of age.""

This data series extends to the 27th February, when test figures were very low (9 tests per day). It is likely this is was the first day, or close to the first day of testing."

Note that the number of laboratories reporting in the data seems to vary from week to week.,"To determine how many laboratory tests regarding SARS-CoV-2 are carried out per calendar week in Germany and how many tests are positive or negative, the RKI has started a Germany-wide laboratory query. However, the number of laboratories reporting data seems to vary from week to week.

The report published on 22 April states that “from the beginning of the collection up to and including calendar week 16/2020”:
– The cumulative total of samples tested was 2,072,669;
- For calendar week 16 (which ends on 19 April), 161 labs reported 323,449 samples tested;
- For calendar week 15 (which ends on 12 April), 160 labs reported 378,881 samples tested;
– For calendar week 14 (which ends on 5 April), 152 labs reported 408,173 samples tested;
– For calendar week 13 (which ends on 29 March), 150 labs reported 361,374 samples tested;
– For calendar week 12 (which ends on 22 March), 152 labs reported 348619 samples tested;
– For calendar week 11 (which ends on 15 March), 114 labs reported 127457 samples tested.
– Up to and including calendar week 10 (which ends on 8 March), 90 labs reported 124,716 samples tested.

By subtracting each weekly change from the cumulative total, we retrospectively work out the cumulative totals by the end of each week.

Since laboratories can post-check the tests of past calendar weeks in the RKI test number query, previous figures may be revised upwards slightly in subsequent reports. The source is explicit that these figures refer to tests performed and that this will not equal the number of people tested, because of multiple tests per person."

More recent reports are explicit that the figures relate to samples tested rather than the number of people: The note mentioned that the figures are ""including more than one sample per person tested"" (""συμπεριλαμβάνονται και περισσότερα από ένα δείγματα ανά άτομο που ελέγχθηκε"").

It is not totally explicit whether the figures cover all testing in Greece: the figures are labelled as ""Samples that have been tested in the laboratories cooperating with EODY"" (""Δείγματα που έχουν ελεγχθεί στα συνεργαζόμενα με τον ΕΟΔΥ εργαστήρια"").

Daily changes in the number of people tested are included in parentheses. For the 3rd April, the daily changes do not reconcile with the cumulative totals. Moreover, it is clear that revisions to past data are simply added to the new cumulative total, making the time series of 'daily tests' too erratic to be published.

This includes two cases where the cumulative number of people tested falls: (1) 19/03 and (2) 25/03. For case (1) see footnote 4 which indicates a past mistake has been noticed and the cumulative figure revised on the date to adjust for this. For case (2), we could not find the associated footnote.

It isn't clear what exact date these cumulative tests date back to, but it is earlier than 10 Feb when the source reports 938 people had been tested. Prior to the 10 Feb, the press releases provide reports of coronavirus infections for the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Yokohama port.

This information includes demographic information of confirmed cases.

These daily reports state the cumulative number of people who have been tested – including the number and share who tested positive. We can use these daily updates to construct a full time-series. Note that the source states that ""Data for the last few days is incomplete and will be updated in upcoming daily reports"", that the ""Number of tested and proportion of positive findings among the tested is affected by changes in test criteria"". It also notes that ""Laboratory data is now retrieved from the new national laboratory database, which gives us [a] more complete data set with regard to sampling date"". Earlier reports noted that ""The figure contains only numbers from laboratories that have reports that include the sampling date"" [all via Google Translate]. As such, this seems to imply an increase in coverage across laboratories over time.

In addition to the aggregate number of people tested, the source provides a regional breakdown, in which it is noted that tests in 'private labs that analyze tests across the country' are excluded. The sum of this breakdown is lower than the aggregate figure provided. We take this as an indication that the main aggregate figure we report includes all private testing.

Daily reports with figures on testing are only available dating back to 16th March. We therefore do not know the first date of testing, only that as of 16th March, 18062 people had been tested.

The time of day to which the testing figures relate appears to have changed. Earlier daily reports refers to those tested up until 3pm (local time) of the previous day. More recent reports relate to those tested up until midnight (local time) of the previous day."

It is possible that the figures are equivalent to the number of people tested, since the number of positive samples reported tend to be equal to the daily number of confirmed cases that the ministry reports.

We include two estimates.

The press release is [here](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/gabinete/notasPrensa.do?metodo=detalle&id=4864).

The second is another Ministry of Health press release released on 27 April and relating to testing conducted up to 23 April. It provides a breakdown across Autonomous Communities (regions), with a total for Spain of 1,035,522 PCR tests. The same release provides a figure of 310,038 antibody tests conducted nationwide. These are different to the PCR tests, as we discuss [here](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing#different-types-of-tests-for-covid-19). Our database aims to not include antibody tests. So in order to provide the data that is most comparable to the other countries in our database, we include only the PCR tests count for this observation.

No other details about the figures are provided in the press release.

One aspect of the most recent Ministry of Health release that is not totally clear is whether the figures provided for each Autonomous Community relate to the 23 April. Comparing the regional breakdowns provided in the Ministry of Health release to those collected from official sources by CIVIO (as of 28 April) suggests that the figure of 203,892 provided for Madrid in the Ministry of Health update –ostensibly dating to the 23 April – may date back to 14 April.

[CIVIO](https://datos.civio.es/dataset/pcr-coronavirus-covid19-espana-comunidades-autonomas/) is a non-profit investigative data journalism organisation who are collating information on tests performed within each Autonomous Community, as released through official channels (communication offices, web pages, press releases and social networks of the different regions). We do not report these figures because their data are not complete: For some autonomous communities, figures are available only irregular intervals. The figures they provide are broadly in-line with those of the 27 April Ministry of Health release, although with somewhat lower figures for some Autonomous Communities. This may be due to the Ministry of Health having access to more recent estimates for these Autonomous Communities."

Taiwan - tests performed,01-05-2020,https://www.cdc.gov.tw/Bulletin/Detail/bJVsQHE6lCY1CMTi1gMcpQ?typeid=9,Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC),,57,63713,2.675,373,0.016,448.333,0.019,Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov.tw/en,"The figures are labelled in the source only as 'tested'. It is unclear whether this relates to the number of individuals tested, or the number of samples tested.","The Taiwanese Centers for Disease Control (CDC) host a dashboard in which they publish the total 'tested' to date, and 'new from yesterday'. It is not clear whether this represents the total number of tests performed, or the number of people tested. The number 'tested' is greater than the sum of confirmed cases and 'excluded' (i.e. negative) test results. This would suggest it does not equal the total number of people tested, or if it does, pending results without a reported outcome are also included.

Although the CDC only show the last day's figures on this dashboard, we can construct a time-series by looking at previous versions on web archive. Where possible we have tried to take the total test counts at the same time every day (those published at 00:30h). Unfortunately this time of publishing from CDC was not always completely consistent. This may lead to small discrepancies between 'total tested' and 'new from 'yesterday' figures. Wherever possible we took the total test count as of 00:30 as the prefered figure; where a day of data was missing we used the 'new from yesterday' figure to calculate the total for the previous day. If there are small discrepancies with other sources, this timing issue is likely to be the cause. In any case it is likely to be minor.

The date from which the total test figures date back to is not known; the CDC dashboard is unavailable in web archives prior to 21st March."

We provide the figures reported as 'persons under investigation' (PUI). PUI is the sum of confirmed cases, the number of people who tested negative, and the number of people for whom results are still pending. All three figures are reported individually from 3rd March until 31st March. From 1st April onwards, the number of people who tested negative and the number for whom results are still pending are no longer reported separately.

We have received communication from Thailand's Ministry of Health (MOH) that individuals who did not meet PUI criteria can pay out of pocket to have their samples tested, referred to as the ""non-PUI"" group. This ""non-PUI"" group is large in the context of Thailand. Daily figures are currently being consolidated by the MOH. At the moment, this ""non-PUI"" group is not reflected in our current figures."

The time series figures sum up to a number slightly higher than the cumulative figure provided for cases tested. We understand this to be equivalent to the number of individuals tested. It is unclear whether the difference between the numbers relates to a genuine distinction in the two figures between the number of indivudals tested and the number of tests performed, or if the differences are due instead to reporting delays or other unintended discrepancies. 

It's important to note that when figures exceed 1000, the Tunisian Ministry of Health report the number of tests per day to the nearest hundred (e.g. 1.6k). 

The first date in the time series of daily tests is 10th March, for which 28 tests were reported."

The earliest press release that lists the cumulative total is 6th April. However, we cannot say with certainty when testing began and the precise date from which cumulative totals begin. 

After the 14th April, press releases by the Office of the Director General publishes the daily number of samples tested. We sum the cumulative total number of samples tested for the previous day with the daily number of samples tested today. For example, the total number of samples tested on the 15th April is equal to the cumulative total up until the 14th April plus the number of samples tested on the 15th April. For the 18th April, we rely on the figure reported by the MOH official twitter account to calculate our cumulative totals.

We are aware of Uganda's [MOH information portal](https://covid19.gou.go.ug/), however, it only lists the 'cumulative # tested' without specifying more precise units of measurement. Our cumulative totals for the number of samples tested from 19/04 matches the 'cumulative # tested' total in the Uganda information portal for 20/04. This suggests the 'cumulative # tested' refers to the samples tested up until the previous day."

Pillar 2: swab testing for health, social care and other essential workers and their households
Pillar 4: serology and swab testing: a national surveillance programme supported by PHE, ONS and Biobank to learn more about the prevalence and spread of the virus

United States - inconsistent units (COVID Tracking Project),01-05-2020,https://covidtracking.com/api/us/daily.csv,COVID Tracking Project,,56,6551810,19.794,305118,0.922,252027.333,0.761,COVID Tracking Project,http://covidtracking.com/,"The data are an aggregation of figures released by individual states. The Project aim to report on the number of people tested, including private labs, but not all states report their figures in this way.","This is a collaborative project launched in order to fill some of the important gaps in the testing figures being collated by the CDC.

Testing data is gathered from individual states, as reported in state health department websites, data dashboards and press releases from officials.

States currently report testing figures in a range of different ways: some report the number of tests performed, others the number of people tested; some include private labs, others not; some report negative test results, others only positive test results; some include pending tests, others do not (below we show figures that exclude explicitly pending results).

Moreover, many states do not explicitly provide details about these important factors needed to interpret the data they provide. 

There are issues in comparing the figures over time. The totals given for early on in the outbreak do not include all states. One significant uncertainty is the extent to which the rapid rise in tests seen from the mid-March in part reflects states beginning to report private lab tests.

Overall the figures should be seen as providing a general indication of testing output, rather than a specific count of a given indicator. Given the very incomplete coverage and reporting delays of the CDC data, it provides a very important additional perspective.

The Project documents their work in lots of detail. See the link provided above for full details."
